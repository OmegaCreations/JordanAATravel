The city was part of the Decapolis – ten Roman cities in the Middle East region linked by culture, trade, and Roman law.
    
🎭 The Roman Theatre hosted various performances: dramas, comedies, and even battle reenactments. Shows were often free to gain public support, serving not only as entertainment but also as propaganda for Roman authority.

🎎 Beyond performances, the theater functioned as a venue for public gatherings and discussions. It was the heart of Philadelphia's social life – where citizens met to discuss city affairs, politics, and culture.

🤵‍♀️ The audience was divided into three tiers: lowest for elites, middle for military and dignitaries, and highest for ordinary citizens.

🏗 Reconstruction and renovation: After the Roman Empire's fall, the theater was partially destroyed and later buried under layers of earth for centuries. It wasn't until the 1950s that it was excavated and partially reconstructed. Today, about 70% of its original structure remains visible!

🔊 Exceptional acoustics: Romans had an excellent understanding of acoustics. In Amman's theater, a whisper on stage can be heard clearly even in the highest rows.

🏤 The theater's side chambers house two museums: the Museum of Popular Traditions and the Jordan Folklore Museum, showcasing the region's rich cultural heritage.`,images:[i,r,o]},{id:2,name:"Amman Citadel",description:`The Citadel in Amman – Heart of Jordan's History
Perched atop Jabal al-Qala'a hill in central Amman, the Citadel stands as a witness to millennia of civilizations and the region's turbulent history. This is where palaces, temples, and structures once stood, now narrating Jordan's epic story.

🏺 The Citadel has been inhabited since prehistoric times – its history stretches back to at least the Bronze Age (c. 1650 BC). Over centuries, it served as the center for powerful empires: Ammonites, Romans, Byzantines, and Umayyads.
