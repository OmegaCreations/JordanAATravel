1. The Name Philadelphia

<img>

At the time when the theater was constructed, the city now known as Amman was called Philadelphia – a name given by Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the ruler of Egypt, in the 3rd century BC. The city was part of the Decapolis – a group of ten Roman cities in the Middle East linked by culture, trade, and Roman law.



2. Entertainment and Propaganda

The Roman Theatre hosted various performances including dramas, comedies, and even battle reenactments. Shows were often free of charge to attract public support, serving not only as entertainment but also as a tool for promoting Roman authority.

3. Civic Life and Discussions

Beyond theatrical performances, the theater functioned as a central venue for public gatherings and discussions. It was the heart of Philadelphia’s social life – a place where citizens met to debate city affairs, politics, and culture.



4. Audience Structure

The seating was divided into three tiers: the lowest for elites, the middle for military and officials, and the highest for ordinary citizens.



5. Decline and Reconstruction

Following the fall of the Roman Empire, the theater was partially destroyed and eventually buried under layers of earth for centuries. It wasn’t until the 1950s that it was excavated and partially reconstructed. Today, approximately 70% of its original structure remains visible.



6. Remarkable Acoustics

The Romans had an outstanding understanding of acoustics. In Amman’s theater, a whisper on stage can still be heard clearly from the highest rows.

7. Museums Within the Theater

The side chambers of the theater now house two museums: the Museum of Popular Traditions and the Jordan Folklore Museum. Both offer rich insight into the cultural heritage of the region.

Perched atop Jabal al-Qala'a hill in the center of Amman, the Citadel stands as a timeless witness to the region's rich and often turbulent history. Once home to palaces, temples, and strategic structures, it now tells the story of Jordan’s layered past.



2. A Site of Continuous Inhabitance

The Citadel has been inhabited since at least the Bronze Age (around 1650 BC), making it one of the oldest continuously used sites in Amman. Over the centuries, it became a strategic and symbolic center for several powerful civilizations – including the Ammonites, Romans, Byzantines, and Umayyads.



3. Key Landmarks to Explore

Temple of Hercules – Built in the 2nd century AD during the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius. The towering columns reflect the scale and grandeur of Roman architecture.

Umayyad Palace – The remnants of an 8th-century complex constructed when the Umayyad dynasty ruled Amman as a provincial capital.

1. Amman: Where Ancient History Meets Modern Energy

<img>

Amman, the vibrant capital and largest city of Jordan, lies at the heart of the country, originally built on seven hills – though modern development now spans many more. With a population of over 4 million, it presents a captivating blend of past and present, where ancient ruins stand alongside glass towers and lively urban districts.



2. A City of Timeless Inhabitance

Amman is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, with a history stretching back 8,500 years. During the Greco-Roman period, it was known as Philadelphia and was part of the cultural and economic alliance known as the Decapolis.



3. Landmarks and Legacy

Among the city’s most iconic sites is the Roman Theatre, built in the 2nd century AD and capable of holding 6,000 spectators – it’s still used for cultural events today.

The Citadel hill hosts several significant structures, including the Temple of Hercules, the Umayyad Palace, and a range of archaeological remains that tell the story of Amman’s rich past.

4. The White City

Amman is often called the "White City" due to its abundance of limestone buildings, which shine under the bright Jordanian sun and create a distinctive, uniform look across the hills.



5. Culture, Cuisine, and Connectivity

Modern Amman is a cultural hub, with attractions like Rainbow Street offering charming cafés, local art galleries, and vibrant souks. The city is also renowned for its hospitality and flavorful cuisine – from falafel and hummus to mansaf, Jordan's national dish, and spiced cardamom coffee.

1. Origins and Development
The area where Petra now stands was inhabited as early as the Neolithic period (around 8500–5500 BCE), as evidenced by archaeological discoveries in nearby settlements like Beidha and Baja.

The city itself was founded in the 8th century BCE by the Edomites and later taken over by the Nabataeans in the 6th century BCE, who developed it into a powerful trading hub. Petra, known as the "Rose City" due to the color of its sandstone, was first mentioned in historical records in 312 BCE.

Thanks to its strategic location along caravan routes connecting Gaza, the Jordan Valley, Aqaba, Kuwait, and Arabia, Petra quickly grew in importance. The eastern entrance to the city is the picturesque Siq—a 1.2 km-long gorge flanked by vertical rock walls reaching up to 200 meters in height.

2. The Golden Age of Petra
Petra reached its peak in the 1st century CE, when it was home to between 20,000 and 30,000 inhabitants. It was during this time that its most famous monuments were built, including the majestic Treasury (Al-Khazneh), the Monastery (Deir), and the Royal Tombs.

The city’s prosperity stemmed from its position along trade routes transporting luxury goods—such as incense, spices, and textiles—between Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and the southern Mediterranean. Pliny the Elder, in his Natural History, described the challenges of this route and explained why incense commanded such high prices in Roman markets.

The Nabataeans also controlled the extraction of bitumen, likely from the Dead Sea, which was used in Egypt for mummification. They spoke a dialect of Aramaic, written in the Syriac script, and inscriptions reveal the names of their rulers—from Aretas I (170 BCE) to Rabbel II (106 CE).

Most of Petra’s surviving structures are tombs, reflecting the Nabataeans’ strong belief in the afterlife. Some tombs contain Aramaic funeral inscriptions detailing burial customs and warnings to grave robbers.

Nabataean religion was polytheistic, with the supreme god Dushara and his female counterpart, Allat. Their depictions evolved from abstract stone blocks into more anthropomorphic forms, later associated with Zeus and Aphrodite.

Despite the arid climate, Petra’s inhabitants developed an advanced water management system. They carved channels into rock, built dams and cisterns—one of which, near the Great Temple, could hold up to 390,000 liters of water.

3. The Roman Period
In 106 CE, Petra was annexed by Emperor Trajan into the Roman Empire, becoming part of the new province of Arabia with its capital in Bosra. The Romans expanded the city, adding colonnaded streets, a theater, baths, and other public buildings.

However, new trade routes established by Rome bypassed Petra, causing the city to decline in importance and the Nabataeans to lose influence.

In 130 CE, Emperor Hadrian visited Petra. The city briefly enjoyed a resurgence under the Antonines and Severans, benefiting from the Pax Romana. After the Council of Nicaea (325 CE), Christianity began to dominate.

In the Middle Ages, Petra was occupied by Crusaders, who built two fortresses there. After its capture by Saladin, the city was largely destroyed. A series of natural disasters—earthquakes in 110, 303, 363, 505, and 551 CE—sealed its fate.

Petra was ultimately abandoned by the late 6th century and remained forgotten, known only to local Bedouins. It wasn’t until 1812 that the city was rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt.

4. Modern Significance
Modern-day Petra lies near the town of Wadi Musa, home to the Ain Musa spring—traditionally believed to be where Moses drew water for the Israelites during their desert journey.

In 1985, Petra was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in 2007, it was named one of the New Seven Wonders of the World.

In 2024, Petra attracted over 1.1 million tourists. The archaeological site covers approximately 264 km² and includes more than 600 carved facades, tombs, temples, and other monuments.

In 2024, archaeologists made a groundbreaking discovery—beneath the famous Treasury, they found a secret 2,000-year-old tomb containing the remains of 12 individuals.`,images:[l,o,r]}];export{m as p};
